# 2048 is an addictive and challenging puzzle game

The goal of the game is to combine matching numbers to create the elusive 2048 tile, but it's not as easy as it sounds!

# How was the game created?
* Created using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
* An array approach was used here to make this game a reality.
* I used different filtering and array methods to get what I needed.
* To get the information displayed on the page, I used document.querySelector to find the exact component we need.
* For the appearance of numbers in random order, a function was used that displays a number in a random place, as well as the chance of a number falling out 2 - 90%, and 4 - 10%.
* For styling, I used my styles to make the game look cool and relaxed.
